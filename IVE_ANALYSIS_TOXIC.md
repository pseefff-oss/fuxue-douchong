**3,604 videos. Three platforms. No excuses.**

## The Verdict (Skip Here If You Can't Handle It)

| Tier | Member | Summary |
|------|--------|---------|
| S | WONYOUNG | She IS IVE. Everyone else is a supporting character. |
| A | GAEUL | The only member whose audience actually cares. |
| B | REI | Content farm. Quantity cosplaying as quality. |
| B- | LIZ | Invisible globally. Carried by Chinese aunties. |
| C | YUJIN | The leader nobody engages with. Algorithmic charity case. |
| D | LEESEO | Why is she getting solo content? |

## WONYOUNG: She's Not Your Bias, She's Everyone's

Let's stop pretending this is a group of equals. WONYOUNG averages 7.6M views per solo TikTok. The group average without her is 3.0M. She is literally worth 2.5 of any other member.

She posts the LEAST content (177 solo videos — REI has 505) and gets the MOST views. She doesn't need volume. She doesn't need the algorithm's help. She shows up, the internet stops scrolling, and 7.6 million people watch.

32.4% of her TikTok videos break 10M. REI, who posts 3x more, hits that rate at 9.1%. WONYOUNG is 3.5x more likely to go viral per video while posting 3x less. Do the math on efficiency and it's embarrassing for everyone else.

On Douyin she averages 507K likes. #2 is LIZ at 161K. That's a 3.1x gap. WONYOUNG's FLOOR on Douyin (P25 = 37K) is higher than YUJIN's median (23K). Her bad days beat YUJIN's normal days on the Chinese internet.

The TikTok P25 stat is the cruelest number in this dataset: WONYOUNG's bottom 25% of videos (2.7M+ views) would be a career highlight for LEESEO.

There is WONYOUNG, and then there is everyone else. The gap isn't closing.

## GAEUL: The One They Sleep On

Here's a fun stat the view count stans don't want to talk about: GAEUL has the highest YouTube engagement rate in the group. 7.00%. Higher than WONYOUNG (6.29%). Higher than YUJIN (6.03%). Way higher than REI (5.67%).

Comment rate? Also #1. 0.094%. People don't just watch GAEUL — they feel something and type about it.

REI gets 952K average YouTube views and produces 54K likes. GAEUL gets 695K and produces 48.7K likes. REI needs 37% more eyeballs to barely beat GAEUL in likes. That's not REI being better. That's the algorithm doing charity work for REI while GAEUL earns every like.

On TikTok: GAEUL has more solo videos above 20M views (2) than YUJIN (0). Read that again. The "leader" of IVE — the one who's supposed to be the face alongside WONYOUNG — has ZERO solo TikTok videos above 20M. GAEUL has more. With fewer total videos. And a lower average.

Her TikTok top-5 average (17.4M) destroys YUJIN's (13.1M). When GAEUL goes viral, she goes BIGGER. Her max (25.3M) is 10M higher than YUJIN's (15.3M). YUJIN's biggest solo TikTok hit wouldn't even crack GAEUL's top 3.

Yes, GAEUL's floor is low. Her median (1.55M) is 5th. But I'd rather be the member who can touch 25M than the member who reliably gets 2.5M and never breaks higher. One of those profiles gets brand deals. The other gets "at least she's consistent."

The fandom undersells GAEUL because they confuse algorithmic reach with actual popularity. The engagement data says the audience that finds GAEUL's content loves it more than any other member's audience loves theirs.

## REI: The Illusion of Relevance

505 solo videos. Five hundred and five. That's more than WONYOUNG, LIZ, and LEESEO combined.

And what does all that content buy her? A YouTube median of 421K — 4th place. Below LEESEO. Let that sink in. REI posts 2x more YouTube content than anyone else and her TYPICAL video gets fewer views than LEESEO's typical video.

Her YouTube engagement rate is 5.67%. Dead last. Tied with LEESEO — the member we're about to identify as the back. REI's engagement rate is the same as the worst member in the group. But sure, she's "#2."

The total views stat is a scam. REI has 839M total solo TikTok views — #1 excluding WONYOUNG! Impressive until you realize she posted 198 videos to get there. WONYOUNG posted 68 and got 520M. Per video: WONYOUNG gets 7.6M, REI gets 4.2M. REI needs to grind out 3x the content to accumulate 1.6x the total. That's not dominance, that's a content treadmill.

Douyin rips the mask off completely. 134 solo videos — the most of any member — and she's LAST. 54.4K average likes. LEESEO (53 videos) averages 99.9K. LIZ (41 videos) averages 161K. Members posting a third of REI's volume are getting 2-3x her engagement on Douyin. When the algorithm can't carry her, the audience doesn't pick her.

REI is the member Starship puts out there because someone has to fill the content calendar. She's the reliable workhorse who shows up every day, posts another video, and gets perfectly average results that look impressive only because she does it 505 times. She's not popular. She's prolific. Those are different things.

## YUJIN: The Leader Tax

YUJIN is the leader of IVE. She's positioned as one of the two centers alongside WONYOUNG. She ranks 2nd on YouTube, 3rd on TikTok. Sounds good on paper.

Now look at what happens when you measure whether anyone actually cares:

- TikTok comment rate: **LAST.** 0.087%.
- YouTube comment rate: **LAST.** 0.062%.
- TikTok like rate: **5th.** 11.84%.
- YouTube like rate: **4th.** 6.03%.

YUJIN finishes last in comment rate on BOTH platforms. Comments are the highest-effort engagement action — someone has to stop, think, and type. YUJIN's content makes people scroll past after watching. They saw it. They didn't care enough to say anything.

Her YouTube comment rate (0.062%) is 34% lower than GAEUL's (0.094%). A member ranked 4th in views generates 52% more comments per view than the member ranked 2nd. That's not a small gap. That's a structural engagement deficit.

And here's the stat that should end every "YUJIN is top 3" argument: her YouTube median is 391K. That's LAST. 6th of 6. Below LEESEO (437K). The member people call "the back" has a higher typical YouTube video than the group's leader.

How is YUJIN's average 2nd (1.06M) but her median last (391K)? Because a handful of viral hits drag her average up while her typical video sits at the bottom. Remove her top 10% of YouTube videos and she's fighting LEESEO for last place. That 1.06M average is a statistical mirage built on outliers.

On TikTok, she has zero solo videos above 20M. Zero. GAEUL has 2. REI has 8. WONYOUNG has 7. Even LIZ has videos approaching that range. YUJIN? Nothing. Her max is 15.3M — 5th out of 6. The leader has a lower TikTok ceiling than the 4th-ranked member.

Douyin: 5th place, 67.2K average, 23.2K median. Below LEESEO's median (51.8K). The Chinese internet looked at YUJIN and said "pass."

YUJIN benefits from positioning and algorithm distribution. She's placed prominently, so the algorithm serves her content widely. But when you measure what happens after people see it — likes, comments, shares — she's consistently at or near the bottom. She has reach without resonance. The algorithm likes YUJIN more than the audience does.

Being the leader means you're supposed to lead. YUJIN leads in exactly one metric: most efficient at converting views into indifference.

## LIZ: Korea's Reject, China's Darling

LIZ on TikTok: 2.7M average. 5th.
LIZ on YouTube: 680K average. 5th.
LIZ on Douyin: 161K average likes. **2nd.**

The global internet said "eh." The Chinese internet said "her." That's the entire LIZ story.

On Douyin, her viral rate at >200K likes (18.9%) is within 2 points of WONYOUNG (20.5%). She's the only member who can even see WONYOUNG from where she's standing on the Chinese platform. Her top-5 Douyin average (608K) is closer to WONYOUNG territory than any other member gets on any platform.

Her TikTok comment rate is #1 — 0.128%, ahead of WONYOUNG. The people who see LIZ's content comment more than they do on anyone else's content, including the biggest member in the group. That's a small but fiercely loyal audience.

But let's not romanticize it. On the platforms that reach 10-100x more people than Douyin, she's 5th. Her TikTok max (15.9M) is 4th. She's not overlooked on global platforms — she's accurately rated. She just happens to have a completely different appeal in a different market.

LIZ is the answer to the question "what if a member was perfectly mediocre everywhere except one specific country?" It's not nothing. Starship should absolutely lean into Chinese promotions with LIZ. But globally? She's filler.

## LEESEO: Dead Weight

Let's count LEESEO's last-place finishes across 19 solo metrics:

TikTok average views: **last.** TikTok median views: **last.** TikTok max views: **last.** TikTok top-5 average: **last.** TikTok average likes: **last.** TikTok median likes: **last.** TikTok average comments: **last.** YouTube average views: **last.** YouTube max views: **last.** YouTube top-5 average: **last.** YouTube average likes: **last.** YouTube average comments: **last.**

That's 12 out of 19 metrics. Last place. The back of the back.

Her TikTok solo average is 2.1M. That's 51% of the other five members' average. She's literally half a member in terms of drawing power. Starship is spending resources giving her solo content that produces half the views it would produce for literally anyone else.

Her TikTok max (14.1M) is less than WONYOUNG's P25 percentile. WONYOUNG's WORST 25% of videos outperform LEESEO's single best video. That's not a gap. That's a canyon.

Viral rates are brutal:
- TikTok >5M: 3.7%. (Next lowest: LIZ at 9.9% — 2.7x higher)
- TikTok >10M: 1.2%. (Next lowest: GAEUL/YUJIN at 5.2% — 4.3x higher)
- TikTok >20M: 0.0%.
- YouTube >5M: 0.0%.
- YouTube >10M: 0.0%.

She has never produced a YouTube video above 5 million views. Ever. In 83 solo videos. WONYOUNG has 4 above 5M in 78 videos. LEESEO is zero for 83.

The "she's consistent" cope: yes, her CV is the lowest. Her median/mean ratio is the highest. She's remarkably stable. She's stably bad. A heart monitor showing a flat line is also very consistent. Consistency at the bottom of the group is not a flex.

Her YouTube likes CV is 58.4% — the tightest distribution in the group. Because she consistently gets 30-40K likes per video. Every time. Never 100K. Never 5K. Just a steady, reliable 30-40K of people mildly enjoying her content and moving on. Meanwhile WONYOUNG's YouTube likes range from 20K to 540K because she actually has videos that break through.

The Douyin argument: she's 3rd on Douyin with 99.9K average likes. That's real. But Douyin is IVE's smallest platform, and 3rd on Douyin with 53 videos doesn't offset being last on TikTok with 81 videos and last on YouTube with 83 videos.

LEESEO contributes 7.2% of solo TikTok views and 9.9% of solo YouTube views. She's getting roughly equal posting opportunities as LIZ (81 vs 81 on TikTok, 83 vs 88 on YouTube) and producing less with them. It's not a sample size problem. It's not an exposure problem. The audience has seen her content. They prefer everyone else.

Every solo video given to LEESEO is a solo video not given to WONYOUNG, GAEUL, or REI — members who would generate 1.5-3.6x more views from that same slot. Every piece of solo LEESEO content is an opportunity cost.

She's the back. The data doesn't lie, and 3,604 videos is enough data to stop making excuses.

## The Uncomfortable Rankings

**By views (what stans quote):**
WONYOUNG >>> REI > YUJIN > GAEUL > LIZ > LEESEO

**By engagement (what actually matters):**
WONYOUNG >>> GAEUL > LIZ > REI > LEESEO > YUJIN

**By viral ceiling (who breaks the internet):**
WONYOUNG >>> REI > GAEUL > YUJIN > LIZ > LEESEO

**By Douyin (Chinese market):**
WONYOUNG >>> LIZ > LEESEO > GAEUL > YUJIN > REI

**By efficiency (views per video posted):**
WONYOUNG >>> REI > YUJIN > GAEUL > LIZ > LEESEO

**By audience loyalty (engagement rate):**
GAEUL > LIZ > WONYOUNG > LEESEO > YUJIN > REI

Notice how YUJIN and REI swap between "looking good" and "looking bad" depending on whether you measure volume or quality. And notice how GAEUL is top 3 on every list except raw views. The view count hierarchy is propaganda. The engagement data is the truth.

## Final Scoreboard

| Member | What They Are | What Stans Think They Are |
|--------|--------------|--------------------------|
| WONYOUNG | The entire group's economic engine | "Just one of six equal members" |
| GAEUL | The most engagement-efficient member with elite ceiling | "The Back" |
| REI | A content farm with last-place YouTube engagement | "The hardest working #2" |
| YUJIN | Last in comments on both platforms with an inflated average | "The reliable leader" |
| LIZ | A Douyin specialist invisible everywhere else | "Underrated queen" |
| LEESEO | Last on 12/19 metrics, never broke 5M on YouTube | "She's only 17, she'll grow" |

3,604 videos. The data is in. Cope accordingly.
