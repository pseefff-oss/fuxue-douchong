## Quick Answer: Who Is the Back?

**LEESEO.**

Across 19 solo performance metrics (average, median, max, top-5 for views/likes/comments/shares on TikTok, YouTube, and Douyin), LEESEO finishes last 12 times. She finishes 5th or 6th on 12 out of 19 metrics. Her average rank across all metrics is 4.74 — the worst in the group. She has zero #1 finishes.

On TikTok, her solo average views (2.1M) are 51% of the other five members' average. Her TikTok max (14.1M) is 43% of the best. Only 3.7% of her TikTok videos cross 5M views — the next lowest is LIZ at 9.9%, nearly 3x higher. She has zero videos above 20M on TikTok and zero above 5M on YouTube.

Her top-end ceiling is so low that her TikTok P90 (the view count her top 10% of videos reach) is 4.1M — below WONYOUNG's *median* (5.0M). Her best TikTok videos perform worse than WONYOUNG's typical video.

She contributes the smallest share of total solo views on both platforms: 7.2% of TikTok solo views and 9.9% of YouTube solo views.

The one nuance: she's 3rd on Douyin and has the tightest distribution (most consistent). But consistency at a low level is still a low level.

It's LEESEO. The data is unambiguous.

## WONYOUNG: In a League of Her Own

**Rank: #1 on 17 of 19 metrics.**

WONYOUNG finishes 1st on every metric except TikTok max views (2nd, behind REI) and TikTok top-5 average (2nd, behind REI). That's it. Two silver medals. Everything else is gold.

Her TikTok solo average (7.6M views) is 1.8x the second-place member. On Douyin, the gap widens to 3.1x over #2 LIZ. She has the highest average, the highest median, and the highest top-5 average on every single platform.

She does this on the lowest volume: 177 solo videos total, the fewest by far. REI has 505. YUJIN has 265. WONYOUNG posts less and gets more, every time.

Her viral rates are absurd. On TikTok, 50% of her solo videos cross 5M, 32.4% cross 10M, and 10.3% cross 20M. The next closest at >10M is REI at 9.1%. On Douyin, 9.1% of her videos cross 1M likes — LEESEO has 1 video above that, everyone else has zero.

She contributes 21.6% of all solo TikTok views despite posting only 10.6% of solo TikTok videos. On YouTube, it's 18.6% of views from 12.5% of videos.

The tradeoff is variance (CV averages 131%) — but her floor is still high. Her TikTok P25 (2.7M) is higher than LEESEO's median and close to GAEUL's median.

There is no debate about #1.

## GAEUL: The Most Engaged Audience

**Avg rank: 4.32. But engagement tells a different story.**

The view count ranking puts GAEUL 4th, but that misses what's most distinctive about her numbers: the people who watch her content engage more deeply than any other member's audience.

**YouTube engagement:**
- Like rate: **#1** at 7.00% (vs REI 5.67%, YUJIN 6.03%)
- Comment rate: **#1** at 0.094% (vs YUJIN 0.062%, REI 0.069%)
- Total engagement rate: **#1** at 7.10%

GAEUL's 695K average YouTube views produce about 48,700 likes per video. REI's 952K average views produce 54,000 likes. REI needs 37% more views to generate only 11% more likes. YUJIN's 1.06M average views produce 63,800 likes — 52% more views than GAEUL for only 31% more likes. The algorithm gives YUJIN and REI more reach, but GAEUL's audience converts at a higher rate.

**TikTok ceiling:**
Her top-5 TikTok average (17.4M) is 3rd overall, ahead of YUJIN (13.1M) by 1.34x. Her TikTok max (25.3M) is 3rd. At the >20M threshold, she has a 2.1% hit rate — YUJIN has 0.0% (zero solo videos above 20M). She has produced more >20M TikTok videos than YUJIN, LIZ, and LEESEO combined.

**Douyin stability:** One of only two members (with WONYOUNG) whose Douyin rank matches their global rank. 4th on TikTok, 4th on Douyin. Her median Douyin likes (37.9K) are 1.63x YUJIN's (23.2K).

The weakness is real: her TikTok median (1.55M) and P25 (825K) are low — 5th among solos. Her TikTok CV (144.5%) is the highest. She is genuinely inconsistent. But inconsistency that produces a high ceiling and an engaged audience is not the same as inconsistency that produces nothing.

GAEUL is not a 4th-place member. She's a member whose impact is underestimated by view counts.

---

## REI: Volume Without Proportional Depth

**Avg rank: 3.00. Inflated by volume.**

REI has produced 505 solo videos — more than WONYOUNG, LIZ, and LEESEO combined (604). She contributes the most total solo views on both TikTok (34.9%, 839M) and YouTube (29.3%, 165M). By total output, she's the engine that keeps IVE's channels alive.

But total views is a volume stat, and per-video, the picture is weaker than it looks.

**YouTube engagement — near the bottom:**
- Like rate: **#6 (last)** at 5.67%
- Comment rate: **#5** at 0.069%
- She gets 952K avg views but only 5.67% like — GAEUL gets 695K views but 7.00% like. In absolute likes per video, REI (54K) barely leads GAEUL (48.7K) despite a 37% view advantage.

**YouTube median tells the story:** Despite posting the most solo YouTube videos (173), her median (421K) is 4th — below LEESEO (437K), GAEUL (426K), and WONYOUNG (600K). More content, same typical performance. The volume pushes her average and total up, but her typical video doesn't outperform members who post half as much.

**TikTok is better but context matters:** Her TikTok solo average (4.2M) is genuinely 2nd, and her TikTok like rate (13.3%) is #1. But she has 198 solo TikTok videos — TikTok's algorithm rewards volume with distribution. Is she 2nd because her content is better, or because the algorithm has 198 chances to find a hit? Her TikTok CV (120.7%) is worse than WONYOUNG, YUJIN, LIZ, and LEESEO.

**Douyin exposes the gap:** On Douyin, where volume doesn't drive algorithmic boost the same way, REI is dead last. 134 solo videos, 54.4K avg likes — last place. Her Douyin top-5 (267K) is the lowest of any member. The Chinese audience, making independent decisions from the global algorithm, doesn't choose REI's content.

REI's 505 videos have real value — channels need content. But her #2/#3 ranking on global platforms overstates her per-video impact. When you control for how much she posts, she's closer to middle of the pack.

---

## YUJIN: Reach Without Resonance

**Avg rank: 3.74. Views overstate engagement.**

YUJIN ranks 2nd on YouTube (1.06M avg views) and 3rd on TikTok (3.4M avg). Her TikTok CV (89.4%) is the best in the group — she's the most consistent member on that platform. These are real strengths.

But every engagement depth metric tells a different story.

**Last in engagement depth on both platforms:**
- TikTok comment rate: **#6 (last)** at 0.087% — 29% below WONYOUNG, 23% below GAEUL, 30% below LIZ
- YouTube comment rate: **#6 (last)** at 0.062% — 34% below GAEUL, 24% below WONYOUNG
- TikTok like rate: **#5** at 11.84%
- YouTube like rate: **#4** at 6.03%

She never finishes above 4th on any engagement rate. Views measure reach — the algorithm serves her content. Engagement rate measures resonance — what the viewer does after seeing it. YUJIN has reach without proportional resonance. More people see her videos, but a smaller fraction feel moved to comment or like.

**Ceiling is capped:** Her TikTok max (15.3M) is 5th — below GAEUL (25.3M), despite YUJIN having a higher average. She has zero solo TikTok videos above 20M. GAEUL has 2, REI has 8, WONYOUNG has 7. YUJIN's consistency means she never drops low, but it also means she never spikes high. Her top-5 TikTok average (13.1M) is 4th.

**Douyin weakness:** She drops to 5th with 67.2K avg likes and a 184% CV (second-worst). Her Douyin median (23.2K) is second-lowest, above only REI. The Chinese market does not gravitate to YUJIN.

**YouTube median reveals something:** Her YouTube median (391K) is actually last — 6th of 6 solo members. Yes, her YouTube *average* is 2nd (1.06M), but her *median* is the lowest. That means her YouTube average is pulled up by a few big hits while her typical video underperforms even LEESEO's. The gap between her YouTube average rank (#2) and YouTube median rank (#6) is the largest disconnect of any member on any platform.

YUJIN is not bad — a 3.4M TikTok average and strong consistency are real. But her engagement data suggests the standard narrative of "YUJIN is #2/#3" is built on algorithmic reach rather than audience connection.

---

## LIZ: Different Market, Different Story

**Avg rank: 4.11. But #2 where it counts for China.**

LIZ is 5th on TikTok, 5th on YouTube. On global platforms she sits in the lower tier: 2.7M TikTok avg, 680K YouTube avg.

But her engagement is better than her views suggest:
- TikTok comment rate: **#1** at 0.128% — ahead of even WONYOUNG (0.123%)
- TikTok like rate: **#2** at 12.81%
- YouTube like rate: **#2** at 6.49%
- YouTube comment rate: **#3** at 0.082%

She doesn't get served as many views, but the viewers she reaches engage deeply. Her TikTok comment rate being #1 is notable — comments are the highest-effort engagement action. More people talk about LIZ's content than any other member's, proportionally.

**Douyin is where she transforms.** Average solo likes: 161K — 2nd only to WONYOUNG. Viral rate at >200K likes: 18.9%, nearly matching WONYOUNG's 20.5%. Top-5 Douyin average: 608K — 2nd. She jumps 3 ranks from her global position.

For a group with Chinese market ambitions, LIZ is the clear #2 asset behind WONYOUNG on Douyin. This isn't noise — it's a consistent pattern across average, median, max, and viral rates.

---

## LEESEO: The Back

**Avg rank: 4.74. Last on 12 of 19 metrics. Bottom two on 12 of 19 metrics.**

LEESEO is the least popular member by every aggregate measure.

**TikTok:** Her solo average (2.1M) is 51% of the other five members' combined average. Her max (14.1M) is 59% of the average max. Only 3.7% of her solo TikTok videos cross 5M views. For comparison: WONYOUNG 50.0%, REI 25.8%, YUJIN 20.9%, GAEUL 13.5%, LIZ 9.9%. LEESEO is at 3.7%. She has zero videos above 20M, same as LIZ and YUJIN — but LIZ and YUJIN have higher averages to compensate.

Her TikTok P90 (4.1M) — the level her top 10% of videos reach — is below WONYOUNG's median (5.0M). Her best videos don't reach what WONYOUNG does on a normal day.

**YouTube:** Solo average 670K (last), max 3.8M (last — 32% of best), top-5 average 2.94M (last). Zero videos above 5M. Her YouTube P90 (1.2M) is the lowest. She contributes 9.9% of solo YouTube views — the smallest share.

**Viral ceiling is absent.** On TikTok: 1.2% >10M hit rate (next lowest: GAEUL/YUJIN at 5.2%). On YouTube: 0% >5M hit rate. She doesn't produce breakout content on either global platform.

**The consistency argument:** LEESEO's defenders would point to her consistency — CV 58.4% on YouTube likes (best in group), median/mean ratio 69.8% (best in group). And yes, she's predictable. But she's predictably below everyone else. A tight distribution centered on 670K YouTube views is not better than a wider distribution centered on 1.06M (YUJIN) or 695K with 7% engagement (GAEUL). Consistency has value when the center is high. LEESEO's center is the lowest.

**Douyin is the bright spot.** She jumps to 3rd (99.9K avg likes, 51.8K median). Her Douyin median is above YUJIN, REI, and GAEUL. Like LIZ, the Chinese audience responds to her more than global audiences do. But 3rd on Douyin doesn't offset last on TikTok and last on YouTube — not when TikTok and YouTube reach 10-100x more people.

**Volume isn't the excuse.** She has 217 solo videos — more than WONYOUNG (177). She has the same TikTok count as LIZ (81 each). LIZ averages 2.7M on TikTok; LEESEO averages 2.1M. She gets equal opportunity and lower results.

LEESEO is the back. She's last in 12 of 19 raw metrics, last in average rank, has the lowest ceiling on global platforms, and her one strength (consistency) is consistency at the lowest level. The Douyin performance hints at potential with Chinese audiences, but on the platforms that matter most for reach, the data is clear.

## Platform Dynamics

### TikTok vs YouTube

TikTok views run 4-6x higher than YouTube for the same member. The ranking order is nearly identical, but YouTube is more top-heavy: viral multipliers are higher (YUJIN's P90/median is 7.4x on YouTube vs 3.0x on TikTok), meaning YouTube hits spike proportionally bigger.

Engagement rates are ~2x higher on TikTok (11.8-13.3%) vs YouTube (5.7-7.0%), consistent with platform norms.

The biggest YouTube anomaly: YUJIN's median (391K, last) vs average (1.06M, 2nd). She has the largest average-median gap on YouTube, meaning a few viral hits inflate an otherwise below-average baseline.

### Douyin vs Everything Else

The hierarchy inverts:

| TikTok Rank | Member | Douyin Rank | Shift |
|-------------|--------|-------------|-------|
| 1 | WONYOUNG | 1 | -- |
| 2 | REI | **6** | -4 |
| 3 | YUJIN | 5 | -2 |
| 4 | GAEUL | 4 | -- |
| 5 | LIZ | **2** | +3 |
| 6 | LEESEO | **3** | +3 |

REI drops 4 ranks. YUJIN drops 2. LIZ and LEESEO each gain 3. Only WONYOUNG and GAEUL hold.

This is the strongest evidence that member popularity is audience-dependent, not fixed. The Chinese market has meaningfully different preferences. REI and YUJIN — the members most boosted by global algorithmic reach — fall hardest when the audience makes independent choices.

## The Engagement vs Views Disconnect

YouTube engagement rate ranking vs views ranking:

| Rank | By Avg Views | By Like Rate | By Comment Rate |
|------|-------------|-------------|----------------|
| 1 | WONYOUNG | **GAEUL** | **GAEUL** |
| 2 | YUJIN | LIZ | WONYOUNG |
| 3 | REI | WONYOUNG | LIZ |
| 4 | GAEUL | YUJIN | LEESEO |
| 5 | LIZ | LEESEO | REI |
| 6 | LEESEO | REI | **YUJIN** |

GAEUL goes from 4th in views to 1st in engagement. REI goes from 3rd to last. YUJIN goes from 2nd to last in comments. The members the algorithm pushes hardest are not the ones audiences connect with most.

---

## Key Takeaways

1. **WONYOUNG is the franchise player.** #1 on 17/19 metrics. 1.8-3.1x ahead of #2 depending on platform. Does it on the lowest volume.

2. **GAEUL is undervalued by views.** #1 YouTube engagement rate, #1 YouTube comment rate, elite TikTok viral ceiling (more >20M videos than YUJIN+LIZ+LEESEO combined). Her audience is smaller but more invested than any other member's.

3. **REI runs on volume, not efficiency.** 505 videos inflate her totals, but per-video engagement is last on YouTube and last on Douyin. Her YouTube median (421K) is 4th despite posting the most. Strip the volume and she's mid-pack.

4. **YUJIN has a resonance gap.** Last in comment rate on both platforms. YouTube median (391K) is dead last despite YouTube average being 2nd — the biggest average/median disconnect in the dataset. The algorithm distributes her content; the audience doesn't engage back proportionally.

5. **LIZ is the Douyin asset.** 5th globally, 2nd in China. #1 TikTok comment rate. Her audiences are small but deeply engaged.

6. **LEESEO is the back.** Last on 12/19 metrics. 51% of others' TikTok average. Zero >20M TikTok videos, zero >5M YouTube videos. Consistent, but at the lowest level. 3rd on Douyin is the only bright spot.

7. **Views and engagement tell different stories.** The standard hierarchy (WONYOUNG > REI/YUJIN > GAEUL > LIZ > LEESEO) is a views ranking. The engagement ranking is closer to WONYOUNG > GAEUL > LIZ > the rest. Both matter, but one measures algorithmic push and the other measures audience pull.
